# multi_ROI_fusion_network

### This is some attempts for my graduation project about Alzheimer's Disease identification based on structual MRI.

I've built feature fusion network based on fully-concatenated, channel-fussion and Kronecker-product method in order to utilize features from numerous brain regions. The result shows that Kronecker Product method can reach better result as arranging the non-linear relations among feature from distinct sources.
